# US Flight Data 2017 Visualization

### Summary
The purpose of this project is to create data visualizations about United States flight data during 2017 using Tableau. The main areas of focus are related to airport traffic, flight delays, and reasons for cancellation by location, carrier, and time of year. The data set for this project was downloaded directly from the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Bureau of Transportation Statistics [website](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=) and is also included in the [github repo](https://github.com/daniel-codes/us-flight-data-2017). More than 5.6 million flight records are used for this project.
